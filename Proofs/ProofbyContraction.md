# Proof by Contradiction

- something very simple that we use every day

Ex:
3sqrt 1332 <= 11

This can be proven by simply calculating it, but there is a simpler way:

- if the assumption is true, we'd be able to cube both sides of the equasion,
  meaning that 1332 <= 11 cubed which is much easier to calculate
  - this is of course not true as calculated this is 1332 <= 1331
  - which immediately means we've contradicted our initial assumption and
    at the same time have proven that 1331 > 1332
