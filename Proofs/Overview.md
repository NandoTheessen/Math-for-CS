# Proofs

Proofs separate the highly likely from the absolute correct
Easy way to really know topics, that you are not able to memoize

What is important to properly prove smth:

- Be sure existing rules are applied properly
- Calculating does not substitute proper understanding
  - f.e. for polynomials, there are certain requirements
    (D != 0, a != 0 in ax2 + ax + c) without which it
    the assumption that each polynomial has 2 roots over C
    can not be proven

**It's doubtful that you really understand smth if you can't explain why it's true**

- this is what proofs are all about in CS & maths
